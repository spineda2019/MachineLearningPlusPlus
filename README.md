# libMachineLearning
This is just a pet project to get matrices and machine learning functions
working in C++. Yes, I know most modern practical ML libraries in python
are already writen in C/C++, but this is moreso for fun! Plus I want to be able
to support this library functionality in C++ (C eventualy) natively!
